# 31: Spec-then-build: discovery, the reconcile loop and the emitted cost

**Context:** OVERVIEW §4 and §6 decide the shape of knarr's loop, and no elicitation ticket's acceptance checks name those decided behaviours. [Decision 0009](../../../docs/decisions/0009-allium-objective-map.md) lists them and assigns them here, in the `config`, `reconcile` and `cost_mapping` modules, next to the clauses that 19, 20 and 21 elicit. Those tickets draft their own spec-then-build follow-ups; they amend this ticket rather than duplicate it.

**What to build:** Clauses for each decided behaviour below, written with the `tend` skill without a live session because OVERVIEW already decides them, then tests derived with `propagate` and the controller code that passes them, in the order the `gleam-change` skill sets.

**Non-goals:** Any open question 19, 20 or 21 owns. The ownership and lifecycle invariants (32). Rate limits and back-off (24).

**Blocked by:** 19, 20, 21, 30, 43

**From 17:** [Decision 0009](../../../docs/decisions/0009-allium-objective-map.md), map rows for §4, §5 and §6.

**MVP critical path:** yes. This is the loop the MVP runs.

**Status:** ready-for-agent, round 2

- [ ] Discovery is a periodic LIST scoped to knarr's namespace and the opt-in selector, with one install per namespace (§4.1, §9.18). Its cadence is 24's.
- [ ] Every pod with a pod IP is polled, whatever its phase or readiness (worker_contract `Discovery`). The pod IP and Ready condition are the `Pod` fields [41](41-k8s-client-spec-then-build.md) adds, and 41's probe removal waits for this ticket's caller, so the two land together.
- [ ] The readiness warning per worker_contract `ReadinessWarning`: a gauge of pods NotReady whose last valid reading maps to a value above 0 under cost_mapping, and a log line on entry, named as 30 decides.
- [ ] The desired annotation state is the mapped cost value (cost_mapping `map`), the opt-in `safe-to-evict` value and the ownership marker (§4.3). How the value is computed is 20's.
- [ ] The `CostMapping` contract (`tier`, `map`, `render`) has a test per invariant: `Continuous`, `Sign`, `Absent`, `Drained`, `Clamp`, `Tiers`, `Crossing`, `Canonical` and `Pure`, by value with the default thresholds 300, 900, 1800, 3600 and margin 60: cost 299 from absent stays absent; 300 maps to 300; applied 300 and cost 500 stays 300; 900 maps to 900; applied 900 and cost 850 stays 900; 839 maps to 839; applied 839 and cost 250 stays 839; 239 maps to absent; applied 950 and cost 250 maps to absent; draining at 100 from applied 300 maps to -1; applied -1 and accepting at 100 maps to absent; applied -1 and draining at 300 maps to 300; absent and draining at 0 maps to -1; 2147483648 maps to 2147483647; margin 0 and a single-threshold list; `tier` at each boundary; `render` of 1, 2147483647 and -1 (canonical, no plus sign or leading zero) and of 0 (no string). The defaults and the per-Deployment overrides flow through config (19).
- [ ] A patch is made only when the desired state differs from the last applied state, which covers a threshold crossing under cost_mapping `map`, the first annotation, startup repair, cleanup and a `safe-to-evict` flip (§4.4). `map` takes the last applied value, the one knarr's marker records; a throttled change is re-derived from the latest reading against the applied value when it goes, so a change that is no longer due has nothing pending.
- [ ] A throttled change stays pending and is not dropped (§4.4).
- [ ] No patch is made once a pod has `deletionTimestamp` set; polling it may continue (§4.5).
- [ ] The emitted `pod-deletion-cost` is a canonical signed decimal int32 string, never a form such as `"+5"` or `"007"` (§6).
- [ ] A pod that has just started stays unannotated until its first valid poll (§5).
- [ ] A Deployment rollout gets no special handling (§8 failure modes, §9.13).
- [ ] Each clause has a test that traces to it, `just check` passes, and the hand-back gives the `plan-spec` obligation count of each module touched.
