# `just initialize`: the one first-run command, and the only step that needs
# network. On a fresh clone with no `just` installed, run it as
# `sh scripts/initialize.sh`; it sets its own PATH, so it needs only pixi. It writes only ignored paths (.pixi/, .tools/, build/) and, in the
# primary checkout, .git/hooks. It never formats, stages, commits or pushes.
# Rerunning it is safe; with everything already present it needs no network.
