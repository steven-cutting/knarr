# Tutorials: first repository check

This introductory exercise confirms that your checkout can run the local gate. It does not deploy Knarr or create a cluster; the controller's walking skeleton is later bootstrap work.

1. Follow the repository's [getting started instructions](../../README.md#getting-started) to initialize the pinned tools and dependencies.
2. Run `just build` from the repository root. A successful build checks the Gleam code with warnings treated as errors.
3. Run `just docs-check` to validate the handbook's metadata and navigation.
4. Run `just check` to exercise the complete local gate. It reports failures without repairing files.

Read the [documentation contract](../reference/documentation-contract.md) to understand a docs failure. The [how-to guide](../how-to/README.md) explains how to register a new page. Deployment tutorials will arrive with runnable controller behaviour.
