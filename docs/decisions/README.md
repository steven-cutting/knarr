# Decision records

These records explain accepted choices and the evidence or source material behind them. Their numbering preserves the bootstrap contract, including the reserved positions for decisions carried from libpawdoku. Adapted records name a source revision and the date Knarr adopted the decision; they do not imply that every dependent implementation ticket is complete.

Read the [project direction](../project/README.md) for proposals and open questions. A later change to an accepted choice should amend or supersede its record explicitly, preserving enough context for a reader to understand why the choice changed.
