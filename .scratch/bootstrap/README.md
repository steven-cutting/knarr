# Bootstrap round: ticket order

The tickets live in [issues/](issues/). Each arrow points from a blocker to the ticket it unblocks, exactly as the ticket's **Blocked by** line states. A dashed orange border marks a `needs-human` ticket (a live session with the maintainer) or an external dependency. A dotted grey border marks a ticket off the MVP critical path.

## Branches

Each ticket is worked on its own branch, in its own git worktree. The branch name is the ticket's file name without `.md`, so [03](issues/03-foundation.md) is worked on `03-foundation`. Ticket 03 fixed this convention, and the root [README](../../README.md#branches-and-worktrees) states it with the worktree rules.

## Execution waves

A wave is the earliest point a ticket can start if every lane runs in parallel: one step after its latest blocker. `needs-human` tickets also wait for a maintainer session.

The longest chain is eleven tickets: 01, 02, 03, 06 or 07, 09, 17, 18, 20, 21 or 23, then 31 or 32, then 33. Tickets 30 to 34 are the follow-ups ticket 17 drafted; 31 to 34 are round 2. Tickets 36 and 37 are the follow-ups ticket 14 drafted.

When a ticket's **Blocked by** line changes, update both the diagram and this table.
